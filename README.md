# Equity-Valuation_Analysis
[DS4100: Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis Project] Spring 2019

Created an equity valuation model using equity data of all companies in the S&P 500 by scraping Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq, storing it in a database using SQLlite, and finally used the stored data to conduct multiple linear regression analyses to give the user a buy or sell recommendation.
